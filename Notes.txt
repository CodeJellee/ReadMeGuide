Tom Preston-Werner: README driven development (RDD) - Write README before anything else
(Can also write readme while coding)
Use of markdown (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Essentials in your README:
-Title (text or image)
-Introduction/Description (what it's about and why it's written)
>what was your motivation
>why did you build this project?
>what problem does it solve?
>what did you learn?
>what makes your project stand out?
*Can also describe challenges faced as well as features planned to implement in the future
*If project is deployed, include link to deployed application
-How to install
-How to Use
-Technologies used (libraries/versions/etc)
-Acknowledgements

**Take a step further and add:
-Table of contents (especially if README is long)
-List of features
-Examples of use (with code or images)
